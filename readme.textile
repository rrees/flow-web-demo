h1. Flowchart demo

This is an example of how to use a Neo4J REST server to provide a flow-based web question and answer application. The examples are based on the kinds of questions that are used to create characters in the Morrowind/Fallout games from Bethesda.

h2. Installing and working with the code

You will need a local instance of the Neo4J server, you can get that from the "Neo Technologies site":http://neo4j.org/download/.

Download and unpack the server, then from the root directory just type: bin/neo4j start.

To start the demo app:

* Clone the github repo: git clone https://github.com/rrees/flow-web-demo.git
* cd flow-web-demo
* Create a virtualenv locally: virtualenv ve
* Activate the virtualenv: source ve/bin/activate
* Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt
* Populate the database with the initial flow data: python create-flowchart-data.py
* Start the web app: python flow.py

You should now have a graph database with a web console at http://localhost:7474 and a web app at http://localhost:8080.
